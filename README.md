## Something you should know about me

Well...by profession and education at the moment I am:

- an interior designer,
- an architect

and...

## **now my journey with frontend begins!**

On this GitHub page there will be a lot of trials, certainly a lot of mistakes at the beginning. But I really enjoy learning new things.

Programming is very interesting for me at the moment.
I, too, can't wait to see in a while all my history and the progress I've made over that time.

If you are reading this, please let me know if you have any insights or comments.

_~~See you~~ Take care!_
